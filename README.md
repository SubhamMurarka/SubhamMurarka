I am a Backend Engineer passionate about system design, distributed systems, and scalable architectures. I specialize in building high-performance services using Golang, databases, and real-time communication technologies.

I have developed scalable applications like a high-throughput URL shortener capable of handling billions of unique URLs and a real-time chat system leveraging Kafka and WebSockets. I also enjoy diving deep into OS-level optimizations, as seen in my parallel file encryption system and many more exciting projects properly documented just go through them.

I worked as a Backend Developer Intern, where I built RESTful APIs, improved system performance using Fiber(Golang) and MongoDB, and wrote test cases to ensure reliability. I keep working on personal projects to explore new technologies and solve interesting problems‚Äîsome of which you can find pinned below.

I am constantly learning and exploring ways to scale and optimize backend services while sharing my learnings along the way.

I am a Backend Engineer passionate about system design, distributed systems, and scalable architectures. I specialize in building high-performance services using Golang, databases, and real-time communication technologies.

I have developed scalable applications, including a high-throughput URL shortener capable of handling billions of unique URLs and a real-time chat system leveraging Kafka and WebSockets. I also enjoy diving deep into OS-level optimizations, as seen in my parallel file encryption system. I have worked on many more exciting projects—feel free to explore them, as they are well-documented.

Previously, I worked as a Backend Developer Intern, where I built RESTful APIs, optimized system performance using Fiber (Golang) and MongoDB, and wrote test cases to ensure reliability.

I am always exploring new technologies and solving interesting problems through personal projects—some of which are pinned below. I'm constantly learning and refining ways to scale and optimize backend services while sharing my learnings along the way.
